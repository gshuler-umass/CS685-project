4 How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
5 What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
9 How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?
10 Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating
the evidence or information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based decision-making, and identifying
potential biases or flaws in thinking.
13 Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and understanding the interconnectedness of various elements.
Focuses on identifying the underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdependencies that influence the problem, and developing holistic
solutions that address the system as a whole.
20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available,
and how can they be analyzed?
29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?
