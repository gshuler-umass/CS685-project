 ""Question Assumptions"": ""Consider the different interpretations of 'kwoz when observing kwox'. Assess and question the assumptions if any, underlying these probabilities."",

 ""Formulate Hypothesis"": ""Based on the analyzed data, form a hypothesis on whether the chance of 'kwoz' is larger when 'kwox' is observed. This is done by weighing and comparing the probabilities."",
