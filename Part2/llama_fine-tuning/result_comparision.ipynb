Is brifft more likely than not brifft overall?\\n\\n### Response:\\n [/INST]  no\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top1_log_probs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.25624803572519944,\n        \"min\": -1.220083475112915,\n        \"max\": -0.006430875044316,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2195,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.0331070981919765,\n          -0.0168975442647933\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top1_texts\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"no\",\n          \"Yes\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top2_log_probs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.9124002147362522,\n        \"min\": -5.1783061027526855,\n        \"max\": -0.7024604082107544,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2196,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -1.2250150442123413,\n          -1.6328003406524658\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top2_texts\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\",\n          \"#\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"llama2_ft_response_processed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"yes\",\n          \"no\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def compute_metrics(df, model_output_col, true_label_col, true_value, false_value, model_name):\n","\n","  true_positives = df[(df[model_output_col] == true_value) & (df[true_label_col] == true_value)].shape[0]\n","  true_negatives = df[(df[model_output_col] == false_value) & (df[true_label_col] == false_value)].shape[0]\n","  false_positives = df[(df[model_output_col] == true_value) & (df[true_label_col] == false_value)].shape[0]\n","  false_negatives = df[(df[model_output_col] == false_value) & (df[true_label_col] == true_value)].shape[0]\n","\n","  precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)\n","  recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)\n","  accuracy = (true_positives + true_negatives) / len(df)\n","  f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)\n","\n","  return {\n","      'model_name' : model_name,\n","      'precision': precision,\n","      'recall': recall,\n","      'accuracy': accuracy,\n","      'f1_score': f1_score\n","  }\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jnwTfnL0ydA3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715473219372,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Anindya Das","userId":"12690028101362253093"}}},"execution_count":46,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rndm_df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":380},"id":"FMuXKXVtLZ8C","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715473330333,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Anindya Das","userId":"12690028101362253093"}},"outputId":"4308af98-a216-4532-80b9-abd360a0789c"},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   question_id                                           desc_id  \\\n","0         3888  nonsense13-frontdoor-marginal-modelNone-spec5-q1   \n","1         8401       nonsense17-frontdoor-nie-modelNone-spec8-q0   \n","2         8132     nonsense17-confounding-ate-modelNone-spec7-q1   \n","3         4701     nonsense14-confounding-ate-modelNone-spec0-q0   \n","4         7168       nonsense16-mediation-ate-modelNone-spec9-q1   \n","\n","                                          given_info  \\\n","0  The overall probability of fritz is 10%.
